> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-itp-node-express-project from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-itp-node-express-project
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and then link it to your local npm repository (this will also compile any changes you make to the local repo):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inthepocket/generator-itp-node-express-project

npm link
```

### Yarn

This generator uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to greatly increase the speed of dependency management. Follow the
instructions at [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to install for your platform.

### Finally

Initiate the generator:

```bash
yo itp-node-express-project
```
